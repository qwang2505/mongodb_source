# This is the whole plan of reading source code of mongodb.

Why read it?
1. To know more about mongodb.
2. To learn c/c++ well.
3. To learn some useful coding skills from reading good coding.
4. To learn more about design patterns.
5. Other...

Plan:
1. Read the whole source code in 3 months. From today(Oct 17, 2012) to Jan 17, 2013.
2. That's all.

Period: 
1. Read docs, build docs, learn basic function of third party libs, learn basic function of 
   system features, read scons files. (One week, deadline Oct 24, 2012)  (CHECK?)
2. From main function, read code abound mongodb. Just read basic functions, ignore master-slave,
   replicaset, shard, and so on. (Four weeks, deadline Nov 24, 2012)  (CHECK?)
3. Read other parts. (Seven weeks, deadline Jan 17, 2013) (CHECK?)

TODO: need more detail period plan.
